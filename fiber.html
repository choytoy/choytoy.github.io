                My first introduction to fiber arts was through my mother, a devoted high school teacher whose career
                served as a vessel to support her artistic self-expression.
                <br>
                <br>
                When I was a young child, she'd thread needles for me and let me pick tiny glass beads from large
                plastic bins full of dividers, which I'd embroider onto fabric to make brooches or small primitive dolls
                and toys. Her interest in fiber art was in turn inspired by my grandmother, who grew up in the
                countryside in Southern France making her own clothes.

                I later rediscovered my love for fabric art via my late mother-in-law, whose grasp of the English
                language was limited at best, but whose personality I could see shine through her clothes; bright and
                floral, all sewn in the basement of my spouse's childhood home. A pattern designer by trade and
                first-generation immigrant to New York City, she attended the New York School of Fashion.

                <br>
                To say I was in awe of her would be an understatement. Since her passing, sewing has enabled me to
                commune with her, to feel close to her
