                I began to learn web and game development during the beginning of the 2020 SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. As an
                immunocompromised person, I feared for my capacity to work from home with a professional background
                in the Social Sciences.
                <br>
                <br>
                Entirely self-taught (with the help of Stack Overflow) I dove into independent game development and
                the "Handmade Web."

                An upcoming point-and-click adventure game using the Adventure Game Studio engine (first released in
                1997). A semi-biographical retelling of the author's personal experiences.

                The game is currently in production, and will feature responsive UI elements including a smartphone with
                contacts that update throughout the story, visually-implemented status effects, and hand-drawn pixel
                art.

                A small horror/thriller "ARG" (Alternate Reality Game) using the browser as a game engine, made up of
                vanilla JS, CSS, and HTML, inspired by the works of director David Cronenberg.
                <br>
                <br>
                The experience takes about 15 minutes and uses logic puzzles and investigative gameplay as tools to
                drive the narrative. Inspired by my love for early Internet and text-based escape games of my childhood.
                All assets, graphics, code, and music are produced by Chaya Friedlander-Abramovitch.

                The game features a short linear narrative on the topic of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and the ease with
                which people moved on from precautions. All pixel art, writing,
                music, and programming is done by Chaya Friedlander-Abramovitch.
