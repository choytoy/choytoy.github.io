                My father works manual labour jobs for half the year so he can photograph for its remainder. As a
                kid, he'd often ask me if I wanted to accompany him on a photography walk. At the break of dawn he'd
                saunter through the snow on Mount Royal with me in toe, snapping film photography of our surroundings.
                I was lucky to grow up in an apartment with a darkroom, and my dad could often be found basked in its
                red light, using prongs to dip things into chemicals I wasn't allowed to touch.

                If I've inherited anything from my father, it's his love for the small details: The brief moments of
                intimacy we share with our surroundings. To me, photos are my biography -- a way to capture memories for
                nobody in particular except myself.

                Unfortunately, film is expensive in 2025. Instead, I use a Canon SLR and favour in-camera techniques to
                generate artifacts, atmosphere, and light effects. Diffusion filters and defracting crystals allow me to
                shoot ethereal photos without fabricating artifacts via post-processing.
