                My name is Chaya Abramovitch (married <i>Au</i>) and I'm a multidisciplinary artist based in Montreal,
                Canada.
                <br>
                <br>
                I work in traditional and digital mediums, and am particularly interested in static web development,
                interactive digital media, photography, and fiber arts.

                Heavily inspired by millennial childhood nostalgia, my art echoes 90s-00s kitsch,
                early online media (web 1.0-2.0), archival horror, and folklore.
                <br>
                <br>
                I make use of recycled and second-hand materials, as well as vintage, open-source, or "small software"
                to create pieces that authentically appeal to my interests. In photography, I use traditional in-body
                effects (lens filters, light projection crystals) and manual lenses.

                My career as a mental health worker and youth counsellor are at the heart of my creative
                self-expression. The work I make is heavily tied to my experience growing up with cPTSD, CSA, and
                physical disabilities.
