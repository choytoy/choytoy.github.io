                <br>
                <br>
                In February of 2025, I began to document a year in my life using photobiographical images
                with a children's toy camera. The handheld digital camera prints black and white labels using thermal
                printing.
                <br>
                <br>
                <!-- The goal of this project is to break down my life's meaning into its simplest visual components: light,
                shape, composition, and contrast.
                <br>
                <br> -->
                This project was initiated concurrently to the loss of my primary source of income as a mental health
                worker for a nonprofit that to this day maintains a spotless public image. My contract was terminated in
                response to my involvement in a unionization campaign, reflective of the ways in which neoliberal
                organizations claiming to echo the voices of the most vulnerable often simultaneously participate in and
                drive class exploitation.
                <br>
                <br>
                In solidarity with my former colleagues, I capture my unemployed life through the lens of a $30 toy
                camera, meditating on the inherent material inaccessibility of biographical archival data and the
                corresponding historical voicelessness of the working class.
                <br>
                <br>
                This project is intended as a counterstatement against union-busting, humanizing the intimate realities
                of employees left behind in the collective fight for fair working conditions. While our employers
                maintain clean, colourful public images, workers make do with the minimal tools at our disposal to give
                a voice to our movement and remind the structures of capitalism that our stories cannot be silenced.

            <p><i>Symphonia (2022)</i>
                <br>
                <br>
                Symphonia emerged from an extended hospital stay at the Hôpital de Verdun from July to August 2022, when
                I was placed in the ICU following a severe case of Legionnaires Pneumonia <i>(Legionella sp.)</i> from
                which I was not expected to recover. Doctors incubated me in a large pivate ICU room,
                in which I was only permitted daily visitations from staff dressed in isolation gowns and visors.
                <br>
                <br>
                This combination of isolation and an elevated fever (107F/41.66C) led to delirium and audiovisual
                hallucinations. Led by these illusions, I photographed my surroundings in the hospital, only
                to find the images were normal upon my recovery some time later. Here, I've edited
                the images to reflect my deliriums.
                <br>
                <br>
                The title of this collection, <i>Symphonia</i>, references the tumour necrotic factor (TNFα)
                biologic monoclonal antibody I was on at the time of my infection, Simponi (gen. Golimumab),
                an immunosuppressant injction to treat my autoimmune axial spondylitis.
                It is an intentional combination of the words Simponi and Symphony, alluding to the chorus
                of instrumental music I heard in my hospital room.
