            <p><i>The Revolution Will be Shot in 2MP (2025)</i>
                <br>
                <br>
                In March of 2025, I began to document a year in my life using photos taken with a children's toy camera.
                The handheld digital camera ejects black and white shipping labels using thermal printing.
                <br>
                <br>
                This project was initiated concurrently to the loss of my primary source of income as a mental health
                worker for a national non-profit organization. My hours were drastically reduced after 4 years of
                service and my medical accommodations were rejected as retaliation for my involvement in a unionization
                campaign and collective agreement bargaining.
                <br>
                <br>
                In solidarity with my colleagues, I capture my (mostly) unemployed life through the lens of a $30 toy
                camera, meditating on the inaccessibility of archival data belonging to employees affected by
                union-busting.
                <br>
                <br>
                This project is intended humanize the lives of employees left behind in the collective fight for fair
                working conditions and disability justice. We have no choice but to make do with the minimal tools at
                our disposal to give a voice to the unionization movement.

            <p><i>Symphonia (2022)</i>
                <br>
                <br>
                Symphonia emerged from an extended hospital stay at L'Hôpital de Verdun from July to August 2022, when
                I was placed in the ICU following a severe case of Legionnaires Disease <i>(Legionella sp.)</i> from
                which I was not expected to recover. Doctors isolated me in a large room, and due to the
                prevalence of SARS-CoV2 and my immunosuppression, I was denied visitations.
                <br>
                <br>
                This combination of isolation and an elevated fever (107F/41.66C) led to delirium and audiovisual
                hallucinations. Led by these illusions, I photographed my surroundings in the hospital, and wrote in
                descriptions of what I observed for my loved ones.
                <br>
                <br>
                The title of this collection, <i>Symphonia</i>, references the tumour necrotic factor (TNFα)
                biologic monoclonal antibody I was on at the time of my infection, Simponi (gen. Golimumab),
                an immunosuppressant injction to treat my axial spondylitis.
                Symphonia is an intentional combination of the words Simponi and Symphony, alluding to the spectral
                chorus of instrumental music I heard in my hospital room.
